## Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using-ANN

### Overview

This project focuses on building a robust fraud detection system for financial transactions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The objective is to identify fraudulent transactions among a large dataset of financial transactions, which can help financial institutions save money and protect their customers from fraud.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: The project begins with a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, including statistical analysis, data visualization, and correlation analysis to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.

- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressing the class imbalance problem is crucial in fraud detection. Various sampling techniques, such as oversampling and undersampling, are employed to balance the dataset.

- **Model Selection**: Multiple machine learning and deep learning models are evaluated, including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, to determine the most effective approach.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search and random search techniques are utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models, optimizing their performance.

- **Performance Metrics**: The project evaluates model performance using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and accuracy. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of each model's effectiveness.

- **Multivariate Gaussian Anomaly Detection**: In addition to traditional machine learning models, the project explores multivariate Gaussian distribution-based anomaly detection for a different perspective on fraud detection.

- **Deep Learning**: A neural network is designed using Keras and TensorFlow to harness the power of deep learning in identifying complex fraud patterns.

- **Threshold Optimization**: The project determines an optimal threshold for classification, balancing precision and recall based on the precision-recall curve.
